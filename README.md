# Pelo CRM

**Every handover, cared for.** Query and hospital-bleed ticketing for JDJ, in the Pelo family: the same brand, emblem and design tokens as the Pelo console. It runs on-premise with Docker.

Every query and every bleed gets a ticket number, a named owner at each stage and a time stamp at each handover. Each clock warns before it goes red.

### Module B: hospital bleeds

| Bleed board: six timed intervals per patient | Bleed ticket: interval audit, photos, geolocation evidence |
|---|---|
| ![Bleed board](docs/screenshots/bleed-board.png) | ![Bleed detail](docs/screenshots/bleed-detail.png) |

| Field app: arrival locked until inside the geofence | Capture: both photos, sticker fields and tubes required |
|---|---|
| ![Field arrival](docs/screenshots/field-arrive.png) | ![Field capture](docs/screenshots/field-capture.png) |

- **One call, many patients.** Client Services logs one request (`HBR-…`) with N patients. Each patient is its own ticket (`BLD-…`) with its own clocks. Several hospitals on one run are just separate requests, so travel times never mix.
- **Seven checkpoints, six intervals.** The intervals are *derived* from the checkpoints, so there can be no untracked gaps (brief §6.2):

  | # | Interval | Starts | Stops |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Response | CS opens the request | Nurse arrives (geofenced) |
  | 2 | Bleed | Arrival | Photos + sticker fields + tubes captured |
  | 3 | Logistics | Capture | Pre-Analytical accepts |
  | 4 | Receiving | Pre-Analytical accepts | Lab accepts |
  | 5 | Processing | Lab accepts | Results released (manual until the LIS interface exists) |
  | 6 | Reporting | Release | Report filed in the folder (geofenced) |

  Limits are in `bleed_limits`, editable in Admin → Settings. The ticket shows its worst interval; amber notifies the stage owner, red notifies Client Services and the department manager. A red interval cannot complete without a breach reason.
- **Geofence** (brief §6.3). Checked on the device *and* on the server. A nurse outside the radius can only proceed by giving a reason, which raises a **geolocation exception** for Client Services. Location is only captured at arrival and at filing.
- **Offline.** The field PWA caches its shell and the nurse's run, and queues arrival, capture (with photos) and filing on the phone. Each action carries the time it actually happened. The server keeps that time (bounded: never before the previous checkpoint, never in the future) and flags the bleed **late sync**. Replays are idempotent. The on-device data is wiped on sign-out.
- **Exceptions** (brief §6.6).
  - An unsuccessful bleed stops the clocks and waits for Client Services to close it.
  - A cancelled bleed closes with a reason, keeps the travel time and is excluded from turnaround statistics.
- **Sample desk.** Pre-Analytical and the laboratory scan the BLD or requisition barcode with a keyboard-wedge scanner and record their stage.

### Central dashboard

![Wall mode](docs/screenshots/wall.png)

| Live: today at a glance, active bleeds, open queries, breach register | Performance: stage times, compliance, volumes, drill-down |
|---|---|
| ![Live](docs/screenshots/dashboard-live.png) | ![Performance](docs/screenshots/dashboard-performance.png) |

- **Opens on the live view** for Client Services and Management (brief §7).
  - Six "today" tiles, the active bleed board and the open query board, both red-first.
  - A **breach register** of every stage that went red today, with its reason, or "pending" while the stage is still running.
  - Refreshes every 20 s.
- **Wall mode** (`/wall`): a full-screen, dark, TV-legible version for the Client Services office.
- **Performance.** Filters sit in one row: date range with presets, region, site/depot, hospital, department, nurse, category, priority and status. It covers:
  - average and median time per bleed stage against its limit
  - compliance per stage, site, hospital and nurse
  - bleeds and compliance per day
  - query volumes by category, site and complainant
  - department first-response and resolution times
  - repeat failures (same complainant, same category)
  - root causes

  Every chart has a hover/keyboard tooltip and a table view, and every row drills down to the underlying tickets. Figures are computed with the same clock code as the tickets, so the dashboard and a ticket never disagree.
- **Department managers** see the dashboard for their own department only. Other departments have no dashboard.
- **Export to Excel** (supervisor, management): summary, stages, compliance breakdowns, department performance, repeats, plus every query and bleed in the period. Bleeds show a patient reference, not full names. Every export is audited.
- **Scheduled e-mails.** A daily operations summary (yesterday) and a monthly management summary (last month), each with the workbook attached. Set the distribution lists in Admin → Settings (`report_daily_recipients`, `report_monthly_recipients`, `report_send_hour`, SAST). Each report is sent exactly once, even with several workers.
- **Full search** (header, `/` key) across queries and bleeds: ticket number, patient, requisition, hospital or complainant, within the caller's scope.

## Brand

Pelo CRM uses the Pelo design system from `supportgonxt/Pelo` (`@pelo/ui`):

- **Emblem and wordmark.** A heart with an ECG line through it; "Pel" plus a coral "o".
- **Palette.**
  - Surfaces: Paper `#F4F8F5`, Mist `#EEF4F0`.
  - Text: Ink `#112019`.
  - Brand: Forest `#0E4D3A`.
  - Charts: Leaf `#16A06A`, validated on light and dark surfaces.
  - Accent and focus ring: Coral.
- **Fonts.** Bricolage Grotesque (headings), Plus Jakarta Sans (text), JetBrains Mono (numbers). They are self-hosted because the CSP and air-gapped sites rule out Google Fonts.
- **Canopy.** The dark forest sidebar and sign-in panel match the Pelo console's command bar.
- **The name is not trademark-cleared yet** (Pelo ADR 0003). It lives only in `BRAND` (`packages/core/src/brand.ts`) and the web `Wordmark`, so a fallback name is a two-file change. Hostnames, domains, e-mail addresses, package names, the database and the `X-Baton-*` integration headers deliberately carry no brand.

## On-premise install

Requirements: Docker Engine 24+ with Compose v2, and a DNS name for the server (e.g. `crm.jdj.local`).

```sh
cp .env.example .env        # set SITE_ADDRESS, APP_URL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, SMTP_*, LDAP_*
./scripts/init.sh           # generates secrets/, builds, starts, creates the administrator
```

The stack has five containers:

| Container | Role |
|---|---|
| `web` | Caddy: TLS, security headers, serves the PWA, proxies `/api` |
| `api` | Fastify API; runs database migrations on start |
| `worker` | SLA escalation every minute and session clean-up; one active worker via advisory lock |
| `db` | PostgreSQL 16, the only stateful service |
| `backup` | nightly `pg_dump` + attachment store, kept for 14 days, in the `backups` volume |

> **Back up `secrets/master_key` separately.** Attachments and bleed photos are encrypted with it. Backups do not contain it, and without it they cannot be decrypted.

**Air-gapped sites:**
1. Build on a connected machine.
2. `docker save baton-api baton-web postgres:16-alpine caddy:2-alpine | gzip > baton.tgz`.
3. `docker load` on the server.

**TLS:**
- Hostnames under `.local` or `.internal` get a certificate from Caddy's internal CA. Distribute its root certificate (in the `caddy_data` volume) to devices.
- To use your own certificate, add `tls /certs/cert.pem /certs/key.pem` to `docker/Caddyfile` and mount the files.

**Active Directory:**
1. Set `LDAP_URL` (LDAPS), `LDAP_BASE_DN` and `LDAP_UPN_SUFFIX`.
2. In **Administration → AD group mapping**, map security groups to a role and department.

Users sign in with their network login, and accounts are created on first sign-in. Nested groups are resolved.

## Development

```sh
npm install
# a Postgres 16 you can reach; defaults to postgres://baton@127.0.0.1:5433/baton
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64 > /tmp/baton.key   # the seed and the API must share the key
export MASTER_KEY_FILE=/tmp/baton.key DATA_DIR=/tmp/baton-data
npm run seed -w @baton/api -- --demo   # reference data + demo users, queries and bleeds
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:web                        # http://localhost:5173
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://baton@127.0.0.1:5433/baton_test npm test
npm run e2e                            # browser journeys against the running dev servers
```

Demo accounts (password `Demo!crm2026`; two-factor is relaxed in demo seed only):

| E-mail | Role |
|---|---|
| agent@crm.local | Client Services Agent |
| supervisor@crm.local | Client Services Supervisor |
| preanalytical@crm.local / analytical@ / logistics@ | Department Responder (sample desk for PRE/ANA) |
| nursing@crm.local / nurse2@crm.local | Nursing, field app at `/field` |
| manager.pre@crm.local | Department Manager (Pre-Analytical) |
| exec@crm.local | Management (read-only) |
| admin@crm.local (`ChangeMe!2026`) | System Administrator |

## Architecture

```
packages/core   Shared rules, used by server (enforcement) and browser (display):
                query state machine, closure gate, SLA/business-hours clock (SAST),
                RBAC matrix, enums
apps/api        Fastify + postgres.js (plain SQL, numbered migrations), bundled with esbuild
apps/web        React 19 + Vite + TanStack Query + Tailwind v4 (PWA)
```

**Design decisions:**
- **One ticket engine.** A query is a `ticket` with one `assignment` per routed department, and each assignment has its own clock. A bleed (Phase 2) is the same ticket with timed checkpoints.
- **Ticket state is derived** from department assignments (`deriveState`). The only explicit transitions are review, call, close and reopen.
- **Clocks.**
  - Categories run on *working hours*: site hours in SAST, with SA public holidays excluded.
  - Or they run *24/7*.
  - Escalation fires at 80 / 100 / 150 % of the limit; the thresholds are configurable.
  - Once the limit is passed, a department cannot respond without a breach reason.
- **Closure is technically impossible without evidence** (brief §5.4). It's enforced three times:
  - The UI shows exactly what is missing.
  - The API rejects the close.
  - A PostgreSQL trigger rejects a close without a satisfied call in the current cycle, all responses accepted, and a Client Services user as closer, even via direct SQL.
- **Not satisfied / reopen.** The ticket starts a new *cycle* and restarts the chosen departments' clocks. A satisfied call from an earlier cycle cannot close the ticket.

## Security and compliance (POPIA, ISO 15189 traceability)

- **RBAC** per brief §4:
  - Only Client Services can open or close a ticket.
  - Departments see only tickets routed to them.
  - Management is read-only.
  - The administrator configures the system but sees no tickets.
- **Audit trail.** `audit_log` is append-only (a trigger blocks UPDATE and DELETE) and **SHA-256 hash-chained**. Administration → Audit trail verifies the chain on demand.
  - It records every transition with actor, time, reason and IP, plus sign-ins, failed sign-ins and admin changes.
  - Viewing an attachment is logged (read audit).
- **Encryption.** Attachments use AES-256-GCM with a random key per file, wrapped by the master key. Files are only served through an authorised, audited API call, with `no-store`.
- **Authentication.**
  - Passwords are hashed with scrypt.
  - TOTP two-factor is mandatory for Client Services, Management and Admin (configurable).
  - An account locks for 15 min after 5 failures (password or TOTP).
  - Sessions are httpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies, stored as SHA-256 hashes, with a 12 h sliding expiry.
- **Transport and headers.** HTTPS with HSTS, a strict CSP (no inline scripts), `X-Frame-Options DENY`, and a camera/geolocation permissions policy.
- **Configuration without developers.** Users, AD groups, categories and routing, time limits, sites and hours, holidays, practices and hospitals (with geofence), escalation thresholds and MFA policy can all be changed in **Administration** with no release.

### Hardening (Phase 4)

- **Independent security review; all findings fixed, each with a regression test (`apps/api/test/security.test.ts`).**
  - Access decisions use the *matched route*, never the raw URL. Percent-encoded paths such as `/api/%61dmin` could previously reach admin routes.
  - AD sign-ins respect account lockout, and failed sign-ins are throttled per IP.
  - Admin and management can never hold department-scoped access; a database constraint enforces it.
  - Pre-Analytical and the lab see only the bleed they hold.
  - No patient details in request logs or e-mails, and STARTTLS to the mail relay.
- **Insights** at the top of the live dashboard, and in the daily e-mail. They are deterministic: each measure is compared with its own recent history. Examples:
  - a bleed stage drifting from its 4-week median
  - a department's first response slowing
  - the worst hospital this week
  - nurses with frequent geolocation exceptions
  - the same complainant raising the same category three or more times in 30 days
- **Proof of presence.** A checkpoint the same nurse could not physically have reached (over 150 km/h since their last one) is flagged as an implausible location, and supervisors are alerted.
  - **Pelo CRM Field for Android** (`apps/android`, Capacitor) wraps the same PWA and reads GPS natively. The server refuses a position Android marks as coming from a **mock-location app**, and no reason can override it.
  - The APK is built by `.github/workflows/android.yml`. Set the server URL when running the workflow.
- **POPIA.**
  - Read audit of every ticket and bleed opened.
  - A **POPIA access report** from Search (supervisor, management): every record about a person and everyone who viewed it.
  - Retention purges (`retention_days`).
- **User guides** ([docs/guides](docs/guides/README.md)): one page per role, for launch training.
- **Launch readiness** ([docs/LAUNCH.md](docs/LAUNCH.md)): what CI proves on every push, and the on-site checks before go-live.
- **Operations** ([docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md)): backup, restore with audit-chain verification, master-key rotation (re-wraps file keys without rewriting files), upgrades, air-gapped install, incidents.
  - Restore and rotation were both drilled during development: identical row counts, chain intact, and every photo decrypts with the new key and none with the old.

### Enhancements

- **Live push.** Boards, the wall screen, the nurse's run and the notification bell update the moment anything changes.
  - How it works: Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` feeds a Server-Sent Events stream at `/api/stream`.
  - Events carry only an entity and an id, and clients refetch through their normal access-checked APIs. The stream therefore discloses nothing a user couldn't already load.
  - Polling remains as a 60-second fallback.
- **Dispatch assist.** When logging a bleed, nurses are ranked with the reasons shown ("Allocated to …", "Last at … · 3 km away", "2 open requests"). The default choice is the suggested nurse.
  - Ranking uses current workload, then distance from the hospital of each nurse's last checkpoint (today only; never coordinates).
  - **Nurse runs** (`/nurses`) shows every nurse's open stops in order, and any unallocated requests.
- **Capture quality.**
  - The phone measures each photo's sharpness (variance of the Laplacian). It asks for a retake when a photo is likely unreadable, and stores the score so reviewers see "may be blurry".
  - Where the browser supports it (Chrome, Android), the requisition number is read from the barcode in the photo.
- **LIS integration** ([docs/LIS.md](docs/LIS.md)). This includes a built-in **SkyLIMS HL7 v2 (MLLP) listener**. It records received, accepted and released automatically, answers every message with an ACK, and keeps no results or patient details from the messages.
  - A signed, timestamped, idempotent webhook records *sample received*, *lab accepted* and *results released* when they happen in the LIS.
  - A late stage without a reason is still recorded, marked pending, and the owning department is asked for the reason.
  - Requisition numbers are checked against the LIS at intake and at capture. Only found / not found and patient match / no match are disclosed.
- **Operations.**
  - The worker writes a heartbeat every minute. If it stops, every API instance notices, and admins and supervisors are alerted (at most hourly).
  - **Administration → System status** shows worker health, last backup, the audit chain, disk space, file store, sessions and migrations.

### Register, quality and productivity

- **Client register** (brief §5.2, **Client register** in the menu). Every complainant is filed once, under their practice or hospital, when their first query is logged. Intake suggests existing entries with their practice and history. Picking one links the new query to it.
  - **Duplicates.** Entries whose names match once titles and punctuation are ignored ("Dr L. Mahlangu" and "L Mahlangu") are listed for a Client Services supervisor. They choose the entry to keep; the others merge into it, their queries move with them, and the merge is audited.
  - Shared phone numbers alone never mark a duplicate: a practice's switchboard is shared by everyone there.
- **Corrective-action effectiveness** (ISO 15189 quality indicator).
  - At closure, Client Services can set a date to check that the corrective action worked.
  - On that date the person who closed the ticket, and CS supervisors, are reminded once.
  - The result (effective or not, with evidence) is recorded on the closed ticket. "Not effective" alerts CS supervisors and the managers of the responding departments.
  - **Dashboard → Quality** lists the checks due and overdue, and the effectiveness rate over 12 months.
- **Productivity.**
  - **@mentions** in ticket notes. Only colleagues who can see the ticket are suggested and notified.
  - **Canned responses** for findings, corrective actions, returns and call notes. Administrators edit them in Administration → Canned responses, for everyone or per department.
  - **Saved views** on the query and bleed boards: save the current filters under a name; each user has their own.
  - **Bulk close** of ended bleeds (report filed or unsuccessful), with a confirmation that lists them.
- **Scale.**
  - Open work is always shown whole. Closed history pages by date ("Load older").
  - Trigram indexes serve search.
  - `npm run loadtest -w @baton/api` builds **100,000 queries and 20,000 bleeds** in a throwaway database. It then times every board, search, dashboard and export path against a response-time budget, and CI runs it on every push.
  - It found and fixed a slow path: 90-day analytics went from 6.7 s to 0.7 s.

  | Path (100k queries, 20k bleeds) | p50 |
  |---|---|
  | Query board, open | 60 ms |
  | Closed history, first page | 7 ms |
  | Search | 80–210 ms |
  | Live dashboard | 70 ms |
  | Performance, 30 / 90 days / 12 months | 0.24 / 0.65 / 3.4 s |
  | Excel export, 30 days | 1.5 s |

- **Tests.**
  - 73 API/DB integration tests, including sign-in and two-factor, a guard over every route, real SMTP delivery and the SkyLIMS feed over a real MLLP socket.
  - 10 browser journeys (`apps/e2e`, Playwright). They cover:
    - the full query lifecycle, including the effectiveness check;
    - the full bleed lifecycle, with the capture done **with the network off** and synced afterwards;
    - the geofence override;
    - live push;
    - dashboard, export and wall mode;
    - role boundaries and system status;
    - register merge, mentions, canned responses, saved views and bulk close.
  - CI runs them against the dev servers **and** against the real Docker stack behind Caddy/HTTPS, including a backup/restore drill, a SkyLIMS listener ACK check on the real container, plus the load test.

## Open items to confirm with JDJ

1. The final time limits per category and priority (the brief says TBC; defaults are seeded and editable).
2. Brief §8 (offline) is missing from the document. It's built as offline capture that syncs later, keeping device time; please confirm.
3. Bleed interval limits (all TBC except reporting at 90 min).
4. SkyLIMS message mapping, requisition field, SkyLog use and requisition lookup, to confirm with Mukon ([docs/LIS.md](docs/LIS.md#skylims-mukon-informatics-hl7-v2-over-mllp)). The HL7 listener is built with a configurable starting mapping.
5. The photo sharpness threshold (currently a blur score of 60) should be tuned on real phone photos of requisitions.
6. Push notifications are off by decision (e-mail + in-app only). Nurses are alerted immediately only while the field app is open.
7. Retention periods for bleed photos and attachments (off by default). Set them to match JDJ's records policy.
8. Department managers currently get a dashboard for their own department; brief rule 2 could be read as excluding them.
