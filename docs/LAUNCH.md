# Launch readiness

## What CI proves on every push

| Area | How it is tested |
|---|---|
| Install | `scripts/init.sh` builds and starts the real stack, generates secrets and creates the administrator. |
| First sign-in | Browser: the administrator must enrol two-factor, sees System status green (worker, audit chain, migrations), then creates a Client Services user, who must also enrol. |
| Sign-in rules | Enforced two-factor; 5 wrong passwords or codes lock the account; sign-out; a password change ends other sessions; expired sessions; deactivated users. |
| Active Directory | Group mapping sets role and department. No group means no access. An AD login cannot take over a local account. Locked AD accounts are refused. (Tested against a simulated directory.) |
| Route guard | Every one of the ~58 API routes refuses anonymous and two-factor-pending callers. The public list is pinned (health, sign-in, signed LIS webhook). |
| Roles and data scope | Departments see only their tickets. Pre-Analytical sees only the bleed it holds. Admin and management can never hold department scope. Percent-encoded path bypasses are blocked. |
| Query journey | Log → route → two departments respond → review → verification call → closure gate → close → effectiveness check (browser, plus API with DB triggers). |
| Bleed journey | Dispatch → geofenced arrival → capture **with the network off** → sync → lab stages → report filed → close. Also covered: geofence override, mock location, implausible locations, late-sync flag, cancellation. |
| Escalation and SLA | Working-hours clocks (SAST, holidays), 80/100/150% escalation, breach reasons, pending reasons from the LIS. |
| Dashboard | Live view and breach register, analytics, Excel export, wall mode, scheduled e-mail reports, the Quality tab, live push within 5 s. |
| Client register | Intake lookup, duplicate detection, supervisor-only audited merge. |
| E-mail | Real SMTP delivery over STARTTLS to a relay with a private-CA certificate. Messages carry a title and link only, never patient details. |
| SkyLIMS | HL7 v2 over a real MLLP socket: received → accepted → released, split frames, replays, partial results, unknown requisitions, malformed input, address allow-list. The real container answers `MSA\|AA`. |
| POPIA | Read audit, subject access export, retention purge, minimisation in logs, e-mail and LIS storage. |
| Audit trail | Hash chain verified after every test suite, after restore, and after key rotation. |
| Backup and restore | `backup.sh` → `restore.sh` run for real. The audit chain is verified and the application comes back. |
| Key rotation | `rotate-key.sh` run for real. Photos still decrypt with the new key, the old key is retired, and the rotation is audited. |
| Security headers | CSP and HSTS through Caddy over HTTPS. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA scan of every main screen (desktop and phone, light and dark). It fails on any serious or critical issue. |
| Performance | 100,000 queries and 20,000 bleeds: every board, search, dashboard and export is timed against a budget. |
| Android | APK builds with the native mock-location check (`android.yml`, run on demand). |
| First administrator | The installer generates a strong password (shown once). The seed refuses an empty, short or demo password. |
| Demo data | `--demo` is refused on a database that holds real accounts. |
| Registration | Invitation e-mails for local users, admin or CSV; links are single-use and expire. "Forgot password" never reveals whether an account exists and is rate-limited. |
| Bulk import | Practices and hospitals (geofence validated) and users from CSV. Every row is checked; nothing is written unless all rows are valid. |
| Readiness | `/api/health/ready` returns 503 until the database, worker and disk are all healthy. CI waits on it. |
| Supply chain | `npm audit` (high or critical fails the build) and a Trivy scan of both images (fixable high or critical fails). |
| Logs | Capped at 5 × 10 MB per container. |
| Every type of user | Each demo role (CS agent, supervisor, four department responders, department manager, management, admin) signs in, lands on its home screen, sees exactly its menu, opens every screen without an error, and is refused (403) by the API outside its role. |
| Mac | The user-type, query and go-live journeys also run in Safari's engine (WebKit) at MacBook size. `⌘K` search, `⌘↩` to send, `Esc` to close; Safari password and code autofill; Add to Dock icon. |

Totals: 79 API/DB tests and 28 browser tests (the Safari engine repeats 13 of them). The browser tests run against the dev servers **and** the Docker stack.

## Decisions JDJ must make before go-live

1. **How nurses' phones reach the server.** It is on-premise at an internal address (`crm.jdj.local`); nurses at hospitals use mobile data. Choose one:
   - a VPN on the phones, pushed by MDM;
   - publish through a DMZ reverse proxy with a public name and certificate.

   The same question applies to SkyLIMS if Mukon hosts it in the cloud.
2. **Recovery targets.** Today backups are nightly on one host: up to 24 h of data could be lost, and recovery means a restore. If that is too much, add continuous database log archiving (point-in-time recovery) or a standby server.
3. **POPIA.**
   - Register the Information Officer.
   - Give nurses a privacy notice about the location captured at checkpoints (staff monitoring).
   - Sign a data-processing agreement with whoever hosts or supports the system.
   - Complete a privacy impact assessment.
4. **Independent penetration test** before real patient data goes in.
5. **Business configuration.**
   - Time limits per category and priority, and the bleed stage limits (the brief says TBC).
   - The SkyLIMS message mapping, confirmed with Mukon.
   - Report distribution lists.
6. **Cut-over.** Finish queries and bleeds already open in the old process there, and start fresh in Pelo CRM. Agree day-one support: who users call, and the escalation path.

## On-site checks before go-live (need JDJ's systems)

Tick each one in the production environment.

- [ ] **DNS and certificate.** `https://crm.jdj.local` opens without a warning on a CS PC and a nurse's phone (Caddy CA installed, or JDJ certificate mounted).
- [ ] **Active Directory.**
  - Put the domain controller's CA in `./certs` and set `LDAP_CA_FILE`.
  - Map the AD groups in Administration.
  - Sign in with one account per role.
  - Check that someone outside the groups is refused.
- [ ] **E-mail relay.** If the relay uses an internal CA, set `SMTP_CA_FILE`. Log a test query and confirm the department receives the e-mail.
- [ ] **Two-factor.** Each CS, management and admin user enrols on their phone at first sign-in.
- [ ] **Hospitals.** Check GPS positions and geofence radii. A nurse stands at each hospital entrance and gets "You are at …".
- [ ] **Field phones.**
  - Install the APK or PWA and sign in.
  - Capture one test bleed in a dead zone and confirm it syncs.
  - Confirm that a fake-GPS app is refused.
- [ ] **SkyLIMS.** Confirm the message mapping with Mukon ([LIS.md](LIS.md)). Then:
  - set `COMPOSE_PROFILES=skylims` and `SKYLIMS_ALLOW`;
  - run `node scripts/hl7-ping.mjs` from the SkyLIMS server;
  - follow one real requisition through received, accepted and released.
- [ ] **Configuration.** Time limits per category (brief: TBC), bleed limits, holidays, sites and hours, report distribution lists, retention.
- [ ] **Backups.**
  - The first nightly backup appears in System status.
  - Off-site copy is configured.
  - `secrets/master_key` is stored in the password vault.
  - One restore drill has been done on a spare host.
- [ ] **Release.** Install from a tagged release tarball (`vX.Y.Z`, see the runbook). System status shows that version.
- [ ] **Monitoring.** JDJ's monitoring watches `/api/health/ready`, disk space and certificate expiry (runbook → Monitoring).
- [ ] **Data loaded.** Practices, hospitals and users imported (Administration → Bulk import); invitations accepted.
- [ ] **Training.** Each team has its [one-page guide](guides/README.md).
- [ ] **No demo data.** Production is installed with `init.sh` only (no `--demo`, which is refused once real accounts exist).
- [ ] **Sign-off.** One CS agent, one department responder, one nurse and one manager each complete their journey with a real (test) patient.
