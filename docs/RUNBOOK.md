# Pelo CRM operations runbook

Everything here runs on the Docker host, from the repository directory. Times are SAST.

## First install

1. Set up DNS (`crm.jdj.local`) and open ports 80/443 to the server.
2. Copy the environment file and fill it in:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   | Setting | What to set |
   |---|---|
   | `SITE_ADDRESS`, `APP_URL` | the server's DNS name |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | the first administrator's password |
   | `SMTP_*` | your mail relay |
   | `LDAP_*` | optional, for AD sign-in |

3. Run `./scripts/init.sh`. It generates `secrets/`, builds, starts, runs the migrations and creates the administrator.
   - If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` is empty, the script generates a strong password and **shows it once**. Write it down; it is not stored.
   - The installer refuses a short password or the demo password.
4. **Store `secrets/master_key` in the password vault now.** Backups do not contain it, and attachments and bleed photos cannot be decrypted without it.
5. Sign in as the administrator. You must set up two-factor sign-in first. Then load and configure:
   - **Administration → Bulk import.** Practices and hospitals (with GPS and geofence) and users, from CSV. Download the template, **Check**, fix any listed lines, then **Import**. Nothing is written unless every row is valid.
   - sites and working hours
   - public holidays (2026–27 are seeded)
   - departments, categories, routing and time limits
   - hospitals (GPS position, geofence radius, allocated nurse)
   - AD groups
   - users
   - Settings: `bleed_limits`, `report_*`, `retention_days`
6. Give the root certificate of Caddy's internal CA to phones and PCs, or mount your own certificate (see the README).

## Daily checks

| Check | How |
|---|---|
| System status | **Administration → System status**: every row green |
| Services healthy | `docker compose ps` shows every container `healthy` / `running` |
| Last night's backup exists | `docker compose logs --since 26h backup` shows `backup <date> ok` |
| Audit trail intact | Administration → Audit trail shows "Hash chain verified" |
| E-mail reports went out | Audit trail shows `report.daily` entries |

## Backups

- **Automatic.** The `backup` container writes a database dump and an attachment archive nightly to the `backups` volume, and keeps 14 days.
- **On demand.** `./scripts/backup.sh` writes to `./backups/` on the host.
- **Off-site.** Copy `backups/` (or the `baton_backups` volume) to off-site storage, following your records policy.
- **The key.** The master key is not in the backup. Keep it in the vault, and keep every retired key until the last backup made with it has expired.

## Restore (and the quarterly restore drill)

```sh
./scripts/restore.sh backups/baton_<ts>.dump backups/blobs_<ts>.tgz
```

1. The script stops the app, replaces the database and attachment store, and restarts.
2. It then verifies the audit hash chain. The expected result is `audit chain intact`.
3. `secrets/master_key` must be the key that was current when the backup was taken.
4. **Drill.** Restore last night's backup onto a spare host once a quarter, sign in, and open a bleed with photos.

Verified during development: a dump restored into a fresh database had identical row counts and an intact chain.

## Rotating the master key

Rotate yearly, or at once if the key may have leaked.

```sh
./scripts/backup.sh && ./scripts/rotate-key.sh
```

- The rotation re-wraps every per-file key in one database transaction. The encrypted files are not rewritten, so it takes seconds.
- It is recorded in the audit trail as `security.master_key_rotated`.
- The old key is kept as `secrets/master_key.retired.<date>`, which you need to restore older backups.
- Verified during development: after rotation, every photo decrypted with the new key and none with the old one.

## Releases and upgrades

Each release is a tag (`vX.Y.Z`). The **Release** workflow publishes one tarball of the images plus a SHA-256 checksum, so the server never builds from source.

```sh
sha256sum -c pelo-crm-X.Y.Z-images.tar.gz.sha256
docker load < pelo-crm-X.Y.Z-images.tar.gz
./scripts/backup.sh                       # always, before an upgrade
sed -i 's/^BATON_VERSION=.*/BATON_VERSION=X.Y.Z/' .env   # add the line if missing
docker compose up -d --no-build
```

- Migrations run automatically when the API starts, each in a transaction. They only move forward.
- **Rollback:** restore the backup taken before the upgrade, then set the previous `BATON_VERSION` and run `docker compose up -d --no-build`.
- **Check the version:** Administration → System status → Version, or `curl -sk https://<host>/api/health/ready`.
- To cut a release, tag the commit on `main`, e.g. `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`.

## Monitoring (from outside the application)

The in-app watchdog e-mails through the application itself, so it cannot report that the application is down. Point JDJ's monitoring (e.g. Zabbix, PRTG or Uptime Kuma) at:

| Check | Expect | Alert when |
|---|---|---|
| `GET https://<host>/api/health/ready` every minute | `200` with `{"ok":true,…}` | anything else for 3 minutes. `503` names the failing part: `database`, `worker` or `disk` (under 5% free). |
| Host disk space | — | under 20% free |
| TLS certificate expiry | — | under 21 days |
| `docker compose ps` via the agent | all containers `running` / `healthy` | a container restarting |

Container logs are capped at 5 × 10 MB per service, so logging cannot fill the disk.

## Air-gapped sites

The release tarball already contains every image (api, web, postgres). Copy it across with the repository checkout (for `docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/` and `docs/`), then follow **Releases and upgrades**. Nothing is downloaded at run time: the fonts are bundled.

## Accounts and registration

- **AD users** need no registration. They sign in with their network login, and their AD group sets role and department.
- **Local users** (for example nurses or contractors outside AD):
  - Administration → Users → **Add**, leaving the password blank, or Bulk import with `auth` = `local`.
  - Each person is e-mailed a one-time link, valid 72 hours, to choose their own password. Roles with two-factor then enrol at first sign-in.
  - To resend: edit the user, tick **E-mail a link to set a new password**, and save.
- **Forgot password:** the sign-in page e-mails a reset link to local accounts (valid 1 hour, single use). The page gives the same answer whether or not the address exists. AD passwords are reset in AD.

## Incidents

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Alert "Pelo CRM worker has stopped" | Escalations, reports and retention are paused. Run `docker compose ps worker` and `docker compose logs --tail 100 worker`, then `docker compose up -d worker`. The alert repeats at most hourly until the worker's heartbeat is back. |
| A user is locked out | Administration → Users → edit → **Unlock account**. It unlocks by itself after 15 minutes. |
| A user lost their phone (2FA) | Administration → Users → edit → **Reset two-factor**. Their sessions end, and they enrol again at their next sign-in. |
| "Chain broken at entry #N" on the audit page | Someone altered the database directly. Preserve the host, restore the last good backup elsewhere and compare entries around #N, then report under your POPIA breach procedure. |
| Nurses report "outside the geofence" at one hospital | Check the hospital's GPS position and radius in Administration → Practices & hospitals. Large campuses usually need 400–600 m. |
| Implausible-location alerts for a nurse | Review the bleed's geolocation evidence. Repeated alerts suggest a fake-GPS app. The Android app refuses to proceed while one is active. |
| System status shows SkyLIMS errors, or lab stages stop arriving | Run `docker compose ps lis` and `docker compose logs --tail 50 lis`, then `node scripts/hl7-ping.mjs <baton-host>` from the SkyLIMS server. If ping answers but stages still don't arrive, compare a real message with `skylims_mapping` (Admin → Settings). The sample desk still works in the meantime. |
| Two register entries for one person | A CS supervisor opens **Client register → Possible duplicates** and chooses the entry to keep. The others merge into it with their queries, and the merge is audited. A merge cannot be undone in the app, so check the practice and number first. |
| Boards or dashboard feel slow | On a spare host, restore a recent backup under a database named `baton_load` and run `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…/baton_load npm run loadtest -w @baton/api`. **The load test wipes that database first**, and refuses to run on any database whose name lacks "test" or "load". Its table shows which path is over budget. |
| E-mail not arriving | `docker compose logs api worker \| grep mail`. The relay must support STARTTLS; for a relay without it, set `SMTP_REQUIRE_TLS=false`. |

## POPIA

- **Access requests (s23).**
  1. A Client Services supervisor or a manager searches for the person in Pelo CRM.
  2. **POPIA access report** downloads every record held about them, and everyone who viewed those records.
  3. The export itself is audited.
- **Minimisation.**
  - Boards show a patient reference (initials and folder number), not the full name.
  - E-mails carry only a title and a link.
  - Request logs omit query strings.
- **Retention.** Set `retention_days` in Settings. Photos and attachments are purged that many days after their ticket closes. The purge runs hourly and is audited as `retention.purged`.
- **Read audit.** Opening a ticket or bleed, and viewing a photo or attachment, is logged per user, once per 15 minutes per record.
